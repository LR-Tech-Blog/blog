- Although the content of the blog posts is open-source, it is only open to grammatical or informational corrections. Users are not allowed to post new content on the blog

### Issues

It's a good starting point to contribute to the blog. Check the open issues and see if you can help with any of them, if you found one that you are interested to help with, comment on it and wait for a maintainer to assign you to it, otherwise, someone else can be working on it and you will be wasting your time.

The issues is to be used to report bugs or sugest new features, so if you have any of these, feel free to open a new issue.

## Deploys

The develop deploy is used to test new features before they are deployed to production, it is updated on every push to the `main` branch in this repository. At the same time, a preview deploy is triggered with the real blog content. Check the [deploy](https://github.com/LR-Tech-Blog/deploy) repository for more information.
