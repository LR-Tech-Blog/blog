# About me
Hi, I'm Luan Roger, a 20y Software Engineering student at UFC (Universidade Federal do Cear√°). I create simple open source softwares, libraries and contribute to other open source projects.

I like to develop open source projects, in addition to contributing to make them better and accessible to everyone, always try to learn something new every day. When I'm not programming, I'm studying or playing some RPG.

Usually I create software that have a short lifetime, but I try to maintain the most used or demanded, otherwise I dedicate my time in other promising projects.

If you like it as much as I do, please consider supporting me and helping to keep the development of open source projects sustainable, help with any amount is greatly appreciated.
